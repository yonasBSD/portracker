# Changelog

All notable changes to portracker will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.9] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

<!-- whatsnew:title=Service status fix on default Docker bridge -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Probes now use the Docker host gateway when a port is bound to 0.0.0.0, so status no longer flips to yellow/red without HOST_OVERRIDE. -->
- **[Probe Host Resolution]**: Service status probes fall back to the Docker host gateway for `0.0.0.0`/`::` ports instead of `127.0.0.1`, fixing false yellow/red statuses on default-bridge installs without `HOST_OVERRIDE`.

## [1.3.8] - 2026-05-04

### Dashboard & UX

<!-- whatsnew:title=Smarter, clearer service status -->
- **[Smarter Service Status]**: Service status with protocol-aware probes, helper-vs-main aggregation, and per-component overrides (resolves #88).
  - **[sub]** Protocol-aware probes for HTTP/HTTPS/TCP/UDP, container state, and finished jobs
  - **[sub]** Helper components degrade the service to yellow instead of turning the whole thing red
  - **[sub]** "Why this status?" popover shows the failing component, the rule that fired, and per-port evidence
  - **[sub]** Per-component role overrides; clear all from Settings > Advanced
  - **[sub]** Clearer port and rolled-up status wording
  - **[sub]** Soft pulsing dot while loading instead of briefly flashing red

<!-- whatsnew:title=Reorganized sidebar -->
- **[Sidebar Reorganization]**: Reorder, sort, resize, and collapse the sidebar, with per-server health and a refreshed timestamp.
  - **[sub]** Drag servers to reorder; order persists across reloads
  - **[sub]** Sort chip cycles Custom / A→Z / Z→A with an inline undo banner
  - **[sub]** Resizable, collapsible icon rail, one-time discovery coachmark
  - **[sub]** Per-server health dot (green / red / blue pulse)
  - **[sub]** Live "Updated Xm ago" label per server

<!-- whatsnew:title=Keyboard shortcuts -->
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts]**: `Cmd/Ctrl+K` focuses search, `Esc` clears, `Cmd/Ctrl+B` toggles the sidebar, `Cmd/Ctrl+R` refreshes, and `1`–`9` quick-switch between servers.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

<!-- whatsnew:title=Better service naming in stack deployments -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Reduced false matches when containers share the same stack name. -->
- **[Container Heuristic]**: Fixed `_getContainerByProcessName` false-positive — now checks image name instead of container name to avoid misattribution in stacks named `portracker-*` (#102 by @leinardi)
<!-- whatsnew:hide -->
- **[Frontend Error Logging]**: Downgraded `ENOENT` log from error to debug when frontend is not built yet (#101 by @leinardi)
<!-- whatsnew:title=Better Docker service icons -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Swarm services keep a recognizable Docker icon when the remote icon lookup fails. -->
- **[Swarm Fallback Icon]**: Docker Swarm services now fall back to the Docker whale icon when CDN lookup fails (#103 by @leinardi)

### Security

<!-- whatsnew:hide -->
- **[npm Vulnerabilities]**: Removed unused root dependencies `jq`, `sqlite3`, and `react-router-dom` that pulled in critical/high transitive vulnerabilities (#100 by @leinardi)

## [1.3.6] - 2026-04-02

### Docker Swarm

<!-- whatsnew:title=Docker Swarm ingress ports group correctly -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Ingress-mode published ports now stay attached to the right Docker service instead of falling back to system ports. -->
- **[Swarm Ingress Support]**: Docker Swarm services using `mode: ingress` published ports are now correctly attributed as Docker services instead of system ports (#98, PR #99 by @leinardi)
  - **[sub]** Swarm port discovery via Docker Services API
  - **[sub]** Shared logic in BaseCollector for both Docker and TrueNAS collectors
  - **[sub]** Dedup keys now include protocol for consistency

### Fixed

<!-- whatsnew:hide -->

<!-- whatsnew:hide -->
- **[CI]**: Fixed Docker build workflow failing on fork PRs due to missing secrets

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-02

### Security

<!-- whatsnew:hide -->
- **Remove Vulnerable SQLite System Packages**: Removed unused `libsqlite3-dev` and `sqlite3` system packages from Docker image to address CVE-2025-7458. portracker uses `better-sqlite3` which bundles its own SQLite 3.49.2 (not affected) and never used the system libraries.

### Fixed

<!-- whatsnew:title=Safer TrueNAS API key transport -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=TrueNAS API key connections now stay on secure WebSocket endpoints. -->
- **TrueNAS API Key Transport Security**: Enforced secure WebSocket usage for TrueNAS API key authentication by restricting secure mode to `wss://` endpoints and skipping insecure `ws://` endpoints.
<!-- whatsnew:hide -->
- **TrueNAS WebSocket Base Handling**: In secure mode, `TRUENAS_WS_BASE` now upgrades insecure `ws://` values to `wss://` and ignores insecure explicit URLs.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

<!-- whatsnew:title=No more duplicate host-network services -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Services using host networking no longer show up twice when discovered through multiple paths. -->
- **Host-Network Service Deduplication**: Added logical deduplication for services using host networking so the same listener is not shown multiple times when discovered through both Docker and process-based collection paths (addresses #82)
<!-- whatsnew:title=Cleaner service port chips -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Services no longer show repeated port chips when entries share the same host port. -->
- **Service Port Rendering**: Updated service view port keys to use full port identity, avoiding repeated port chips when entries share the same host port number

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Ports**: Skip internal Docker ports when a published binding exists, preventing duplicate rows for the same container port (addresses #82)

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Ports**: Fixed duplicate port entries caused by IPv4/IPv6 wildcard addresses and internal port detection (resolves #82)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

<!-- whatsnew:title=Fresh installs work again -->
<!-- whatsnew:description=Fixed a missing column that broke brand-new installs on first launch. -->
- **Database Schema**: Fixed missing `remote_api_key` column in initial database creation that caused "no such column" errors for fresh installations (resolves #82)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-02
