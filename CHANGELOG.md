# Changelog

All notable changes to portracker will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **Host-Network Service Deduplication**: Added logical deduplication for services using host networking so the same listener is not shown multiple times when discovered through both Docker and process-based collection paths (addresses #82)
- **Service Port Rendering**: Updated service view port keys to use full port identity, avoiding repeated port chips when entries share the same host port number

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Ports**: Skip internal Docker ports when a published binding exists, preventing duplicate rows for the same container port (addresses #82)

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Ports**: Fixed duplicate port entries caused by IPv4/IPv6 wildcard addresses and internal port detection (resolves #82)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **Database Schema**: Fixed missing `remote_api_key` column in initial database creation that caused "no such column" errors for fresh installations (resolves #82)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-02

**Highlights**
- Service-Centric View - Ports organized by service with expandable cards (now default)
- API Key Authentication - Secure peer-to-peer communication between instances
- autoxpose Integration - See publicly exposed services directly in your dashboard

### Fixed

- **System Port Detection**: Restored system port detection (SSH, SMB, etc.) when running in containerized environments.

### Dashboard

- **Service-Centric View**: View your ports organized by service name with expandable cards showing all ports per service (now the default view)
- **Service Icons**: Visual icons automatically loaded for known services with theme-aware variants for dark and light modes

### UI

- **Collapsed Health Status**: Collapsed service cards now show an aggregated health indicator so you can see status at a glance without expanding
